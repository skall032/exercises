<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<hr>

<h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>
<h3>If 1 could visit anywhere in the world, where would it be?</h3>
<p>I would really like to go to Norway. My grand father is from norway and I still have family living in Oslo and the small town of Fredrikstad. I would love to see my familial roots!</p>
<br>
<h2>A person I admire (past or present).</h2>
<p>I really admire my friend Rachel. She has been through a lot in her life but she still manages to go out bravely into the world and break down barriers, whether personal or cultural! She's currently in Korea working towards an International Studies degree with hopes of someday being a representative for the United Nations.</p>
